      <h1 className="underline decoration-accent-color font-semibold text-md">Here is how everything began!</h1>
      <p>Our journey began over three decades ago, with a simple yet profound belief: nature offers the best, and it&apos;s our responsibility to preserve its purity. 33 years ago, nestled in the heart of Greece, our family-owned business was born from a deep love for beekeeping and a passion for bringing the purest honey to your table.</p>

      <p>Back then, it started with a few hives, a lot of patience, and a dream to craft honey that stayed true to its roots—natural, unprocessed, and full of the rich flavors of the land. Over the years, our commitment to quality has only grown, as we&apos;ve expanded from local farmer&apos;s markets to homes across the world, all while staying true to the values that started it all.</p>

      <h2><span className="font-semibold">1991:</span> The Beginning of a Sweet Legacy</h2>
      <p>In 1991, just a few years after our humble beginnings, Regal Hive celebrated its first major achievement: expanding from a small, local operation to a regional supplier of pure, natural honey. This was a defining moment for us, as we began supplying our honey to local stores and markets across Greece, sharing the taste of our carefully crafted honey with a growing community.</p>

      <p>What made this year special was not just the expansion, but also the recognition we received for our commitment to producing raw, unfiltered honey—harvested in harmony with nature. This achievement laid the foundation for the growth and success that would follow in the years ahead.</p>

      <h3><span className="font-semibold">2015:</span> Expanding Our Horizons</h3>
      <p>At RegalHive, we&apos;re proud to say that every jar of honey tells a story. A story of hard work, tradition, and sustainability. Our bees are lovingly cared for in pristine, pesticide-free environments, allowing them to thrive and produce honey that&apos;s as pure as nature intended. We&apos;ve also maintained a hands-on, artisanal approach, ensuring that each batch is harvested with care and bottled without unnecessary processing.</p>

      <p>In 2015, RegalHive reached a major milestone when we expanded our operations beyond local markets and began distributing our honey nationwide. This achievement marked a turning point for us, as our commitment to quality and sustainability garnered the attention of honey lovers across the country. We also introduced our Lavender honey, which became an instant favorite for its unique flavor and all-natural, raw goodness.</p>

      <h4><span className="font-semibold">2022:</span> Leading the Way in Sustainability</h4>
      <p>  In 2022, Regal Hive proudly achieved one of our most significant goals: becoming fully certified as an organic and bee-friendly farming honey producer. This certification recognized our long-standing commitment to ethical beekeeping, sustainable practices, and environmental stewardship.</p>

      <p>We also launched our Acacia honey, featuring honey infused with natural flavors, which quickly became a customer favorite. Additionally, we were honored to be named one of the top eco-conscious honey brands in Greece, reaffirming our position as a leader in both quality and sustainability. This achievement has inspired us to keep pushing the boundaries of what&apos;s possible in sustainable honey production, ensuring that our legacy will continue to thrive for generations to come.</p>
